        <h3>So you're curious about my opinions on things</h3>
        <p> What a mistake. Anyway, welcome to my technical blog. Here I will attempt to document any projects I may decide to do. 
            Or I'll be lazy and this will be empty. Who knows? Warning: there is no guarantee that I know what I'm talking about, only the guarantee that I
            will act like I know what I'm talking about.
