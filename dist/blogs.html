            These blog posts will go one of three ways: 
            <ul>
                <li>I will explain some topic I tried learning as an exercise to test my own understanding</li>
                <li>I will introduce ome project I worked on</li>
                <li>I won't write anything because I'm lazy</li>
        </p>
        <ul>
            
        </ul>
