		<h1>Welcome to my Website</h1>
		<p>I'm Otto Jursch. The point of this website is to show off my
		frontend design skills. Just kidding. The real purpose of this 
		website is to give me a place to write about whatever I'm trying 
		to learn at that moment. The idea is that if I can explain what
		I've learned effectively, then I actually have a pretty good
		understanding of it. The reason this is public is because I have
		delusions that people will post something I write here to HackerNews
		and it will get lots of upvotes. 

		The explanation for the website's "college professor syllabus"
		aesthetic is a combination of laziness and hatred of CSS.

		<h3>About Me</h3>
		<p>I'm a 20 year old college student at UC San Diego (not San
		Diego State. UC San Diego, the school in San Diego you haven't
		heard of because we hate sports). I like writing code. My code
		doesn't really like to work. I'm trying to fix that. I also like
		basketball.
